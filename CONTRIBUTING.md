### Quality Assurance
QA & Testing of a cloud management tool is particularly challenging as it requires validating the integration of multiple software components, from different hypervisors and storage architectures to operating systems and DB backends.

As part of OpenNebula QA we perform the following activities:

* Development and maintenance of a testing framework to exercise all the OpenNebula components
* Maintenance of a testing infrastructure with multiple hypervisors and storage configurations
* Regular test execution and circling feedback through to the development process by filing issues
* Manage up-to-date set of test cases for wide functionality scenario coverage.
* Automation of testing and bug identification process

You can find how to help us on the [Quality Assurance Page](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/wiki/Quality-Assurance)

### Localization
We welcome contributions also to translate our platform to different languages. We use Transifex to localize the project, so you'll need to create an account (if you don't have one), or use your existing Transifex credential. Please check the status of the locale on the [OpenNebula Transifex page](https://explore.transifex.com/opennebula/one/)

### Report a Vulnerability
The OpenNebula Vulnerability Management Team (VMT) is responsible for coordinating the process of evaluating, fixing and disclosing those security vulnerabilities reported by members of the OpenNebula Community. Members of the VMT are all part of the Engineering Team at [OpenNebula Systems](https://opennebula.io), the company that manages and coordinates the development of the OpenNebula project. Membership of this team is intentionally limited to a small number of people.

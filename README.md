# OpenNebula

## Description

OpenNebula is an open-source project delivering a simple but feature-rich and
flexible solution to build and manage enterprise clouds and virtualized data centers.

Complete documentation: https://docs.opennebula.org

## Installation

### Requirements

This machine will act as the OpenNebula server and therefore needs to have
installed the following software:

* **ruby** >= 1.8.7
* **sqlite3** >= 3.5.2
* **xmlrpc-c** >= 1.06
* **openssl** >= 0.9
* **ssh**
* **sqlite3-ruby** gem

Additionally, to build OpenNebula from source you need:

* Development versions of the **sqlite3**, **xmlrpc-c** and **openssl**
  packages, if your distribution does not install them with the libraries.
* **scons** >= 0.97
* **g++** >= 4
* **flex** >= 2.5 (optional, only needed to rebuild the parsers)
* **bison** >= 2.3 (optional, only needed to rebuild the parsers)
* **libxml2-dev**

### Ruby Libraries Requirements

A set of gem requirements are needed to make several components work. We
include a handy script to install them and the requirements. It is located at
`share/install_gems/install_gems` and you should use it to install the
required gems. You have more information at:

  https://docs.opennebula.org/5.4/integration/references/compile.html

If you want to install them manually here are the list of required rubygems:

* OpenNebula and clients (plus cloud interfaces)
  * sqlite3
  * json
  * sequel
  * mysql
  * net-ldap
  * amazon-ec2
  * rack
  * sinatra
  * thin
  * uuidtools
  * curb
  * nokogiri

* Sunstone server
  * json
  * rack
  * sinatra
  * thin
  * sequel
  * nokogiri

### Optional Packages

These packages are not needed to run or build OpenNebula. They improve the
performance of the user-land libraries and tools of OpenNebula, nor the core
system. You will probably experiment a more responsive CLI.

First install rubygems and ruby development libraries

* **ruby-dev**
* **rubygems**
* **rake**
* **make**

Then install the following packages:

* **ruby xmlparser**, some distributions include a binary package for this
  (**libxml-parser-ruby1.8**). If it is not available in your distribution
  install expat libraries with its development files and install xmlparser
  using gem:

        $ sudo gem install xmlparser --no-ri --no-rdoc

  Note the extra parameters to gem install. Some versions of xmlparser have
  problems building the documentation and we can use it without documentation
  installed.

* **ruby ox**, fast xml parsing library:

        $ sudo gem install ox --no-ri --no-rdoc


### Building

Compilation is done using **scons** command:

        $ scons [OPTION=VALUE]

The argument expression *[OPTIONAL]* is used to set non-default values for:

        OPTION      VALUE
        sqlite_db   path-to-sqlite-install
        sqlite      no if you don't want to build sqlite support
        mysql       yes if you want to build mysql support
        xmlrpc      path-to-xmlrpc-install
        parsers     yes if you want to rebuild flex/bison files
        new_xmlrpc  yes if you have an xmlrpc-c version >= 1.31
        sunstone    yes if you want to build sunstone minified files
        systemd     yes if you want to build systemd support


### Installation

OpenNebula can be installed in two modes: system-wide, or in self-contained
directory. In either case, you do not need to run OpenNebula as root. These
options can be specified when running the install script:

        $ ./install.sh install_options

where **install_options** can be one or more of:

    OPTION  VALUE
    -u      user that will run OpenNebula, defaults to user executing
            install.sh
    -g      group of the user that will run OpenNebula, defaults to user
            executing install.sh
    -k      keep current configuration files, useful when upgrading
    -d      target installation directory. If defined, it will specified
            the path for the self-contained install. If not defined, the
            installation will be performed system wide
    -c      only install client utilities: OpenNebula cli, occi and ec2
            client files
    -r      remove Opennebula, only useful if -d was not specified,
            otherwise rm -rf $ONE_LOCATION would do the job
    -p      do not install OpenNebula Sunstone non-minified files
    -G      install only OpenNebula Gate
    -f      install only OpenNebula Flow
    -h      prints installer help

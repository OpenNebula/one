#
#  HTTP_PROXY: Proxy for ONE_XMLRPC
#
#  SCHED_INTERVAL: Seconds between two scheduling actions
#
#  MAX_VM: Maximum number of Virtual Machines scheduled in each scheduling
#          action. Use 0 to schedule all pending VMs each time.
#
#  MAX_DISPATCH: Maximum number of Virtual Machines dispatched in each
#                scheduling action
#
#  MAX_HOST: Maximum number of Virtual Machines dispatched to each host in
#            each scheduling action
#
#  LIVE_RESCHEDS: Perform live (1) or cold migrations (0) when rescheduling a VM
#
#  COLD_MIGRATE_MODE: Type of cold migration, see documentation for one.vm.migrate
#      0 = save - default
#      1 = poweroff
#      2 = poweroff-hard
#
#  DEFAULT_SCHED: Definition of the default scheduling algorithm
#    - policy:
#      0 = Packing. Heuristic that minimizes the number of hosts in use by
#          packing the VMs in the hosts to reduce VM fragmentation
#      1 = Striping. Heuristic that tries to maximize resources available for
#          the VMs by spreading the VMs in the hosts
#      2 = Load-aware. Heuristic that tries to maximize resources available for
#          the VMs by using those nodes with less load
#      3 = Custom.
#          - rank: Custom arithmetic expression to rank suitable hosts based in
#            their attributes
#      4 = Fixed. Hosts will be ranked according to the PRIORITY attribute found
#          in the Host or Cluster template.
#
#  DEFAULT_DS_SCHED: Definition of the default storage scheduling algorithm
#    - policy:
#      0 = Packing. Tries to optimize storage usage by selecting the DS with
#          less free space
#      1 = Striping. Tries to optimize I/O by distributing the VMs across
#          datastores.
#      2 = Custom.
#          - rank: Custom arithmetic expression to rank suitable datastores based
#          on their attributes
#      3 = Fixed. Datastores will be ranked according to the PRIORITY attribute
#          found in the Datastore template.
#
#  DEFAULT_NIC_SCHED: Definition of the default virtual network scheduler
#    - policy:
#      0 = Packing. Tries to pack address usage by selecting the VNET with
#          less free leases
#      1 = Striping. Tries to distribute address usage across VNETs.
#      2 = Custom.
#          - rank: Custom arithmetic expression to rank suitable datastores based
#          on their attributes
#      3 = Fixed. Virtual Networks will be ranked according to the PRIORITY
#          attribute found in the Virtual Network template.
#
#  DIFFERENT_VNETS: When set (YES) the NICs of a VM will be forced to be in
#  different Virtual Networks.
#
#  LOG: Configuration for the logging system
#    - system: defines the logging system:
#          file      to log in the sched.log file
#          syslog    to use the syslog facilities
#          std       to use the default log stream (stderr) to use with systemd
#    - debug_level:
#           0 = ERROR
#           1 = WARNING
#           2 = INFO
#           3 = DEBUG   Includes general scheduling information (default)
#           4 = DDEBUG  Includes time taken for each step
#           5 = DDDEBUG Includes detailed information about the scheduling
#                       decision, such as VM requirements, Host ranking for
#                       each VM, etc. This will impact the performance
#
#  MEMORY_SYSTEM_DS_SCALE: This factor scales the VM usage of the system DS with
#  the memory size. This factor can be use to make the scheduler consider the
#  overhead of checkpoint files:
#       system_ds_usage = system_ds_usage + memory_system_ds_scale * memory
#
#  MAX_BACKUPS: Maximum number of concurrent backup operations in the cloud.
#  The scheduler will not start pending scheduled backups beyond this limit
#
#  MAX_BACKUPS_HOST: Maximum number of active backup operations per host.
#
#  EXTERNAL_SCHEDULER: Configuration to contact an external scheduler module:
#    - SERVER: the http URL to perform the POST operation
#    - PROXY: if needed to contact the external scheduler
#    - TIMEOUT: how long to wait for a response
#
#  VM_ATTRIBUTE: Attributes serialized to External Scheduler, the format is:
#  "xpath<:target_name>" where:
#    - xpath is the xpath of the attribute
#    - target_name (OPTIONAL) is the name of the attribute used in the JSON doc
#      sent to the external scheduler, if not set the original name will be used.
#
#    Examples:
#        VM_ATTRIBUTE = "/VM/TEMPLATE/CPU"
#        VM_ATTRIBUTE = "//CPU"
#        VM_ATTRIBUTE = "/VM/TEMPLATE/VMGROUP/ROLE:GROUP_ROLE"

noVNC packaging steps for Debian/Ubuntu:

- Update the noVNC version in docs/VERSION and add a new entry for the
  version in debian/changelog

- Rename the novnc source directory to match the form "novnc-VERSION".

- In the novnc source directory, run the packaging command:

    debuild -I -uc -us

    - The -I option ignores the .git directory when generating the
      source tarball.
    - the -uc and -us may be omitted in order to create a signed
      package.

    - Alternatively, use pbuilder instead of debuild in order to build
      for other distributions and to guarantee a sanitized package.

- Verify the package and then commit the changes to docs/VERSION and
  debian/changelog.

- Upload the new package file(s).

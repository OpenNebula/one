## noVNC: HTML5 VNC Client


### Description

noVNC is a HTML5 VNC client that runs well in any modern browser
including mobile browsers (iPhone/iPad and Android).

Many companies/projects have integrated noVNC including [Ganeti Web
Manager](http://code.osuosl.org/projects/ganeti-webmgr),
[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org),
[OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org/), and
[LibVNCServer](http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net). See [the Projects
and Companies wiki
page](https://github.com/kanaka/noVNC/wiki/ProjectsCompanies-using-noVNC)
for a more complete list with additional info and links.

### Browser Requirements

* HTML5 Canvas (with createImageData): Chrome, Firefox 3.6+, iOS
  Safari, Opera 11+, Internet Explorer 9+, etc.

* HTML5 WebSockets: For browsers that do not have builtin
  WebSockets support, the project includes
  <a href="http://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js">web-socket-js</a>,
  a WebSockets emulator using Adobe Flash. iOS 4.2+ has built-in
  WebSocket support.

* Fast Javascript Engine: this is not strictly a requirement, but
  without a fast Javascript engine, noVNC might be painfully slow.

* See the more detailed [browser compatibility wiki page](https://github.com/kanaka/noVNC/wiki/Browser-support).


### Server Requirements

Unless you are using a VNC server with support for WebSockets
connections (such as
[x11vnc/libvncserver](http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/),
[QEMU](http://www.qemu.org/), or
[PocketVNC](http://www.pocketvnc.com/blog/?page_id=866)), you need to
use a WebSockets to TCP socket proxy. There is a python proxy included
('websockify').


### Quick Start

* Use the launch script to start a mini-webserver and the WebSockets
  proxy (websockify). The `--vnc` option is used to specify the location of
  a running VNC server:

    `./utils/launch.sh --vnc localhost:5901`

* Point your browser to the cut-and-paste URL that is output by the
  launch script. Enter a password if the VNC server has one
  configured. Hit the Connect button and enjoy!

# Traditional Uploader Server-Side Notes & Requirements {: .page-header }

In the server folder you will find some examples for different platforms. If
you can't find the one you need, please read up on the server-side guidelines
handling multipart form requests and XHR upload requests in your server-side
language of choice.

Note that you can fine server-side examples in the [Fine Uploader Server repository](https://github.com/Widen/fine-uploader-server).

## Handling the request (defaults)
By default Fine Uploader will send the file in the body of a multipart encoded
POST request.  The filename will be encoded in the request, but the parameters
will be available in the query string only.  Note that, if chunking is enabled,
the filename in the content-disposition header of the file boundary will have a
value of "blob" so you will need to parse the value of the "qqfilename"
parameter in this case to determine the name of the associated file.

Note that each request contains a UUID parameter.  By default, the name of this
parameter is `qquuid`, but this is configurable in the [`request` option section](../api/options.html).
This parameter value should be used to uniquely identify the file, and the
association between this UUID and the file should be maintained
sever-side if you want to handle DELETE requests, the resume feature, or chunking.

"""iOS devices use 'image.jpg' for **all** image file names. Ensure to save your
files with the UUID somewhere in that file's path to ensure users are not
overwriting each others' files.""", "warning", "Note:") }}

## Request Format Options
If you would like to ensure all parameters are sent in the request body
(instead of the query string), you must set the `paramsInBody` [request option](../api/options.html)
(which will also force all requests to be multipart encoded as well).

{{ alert(
"""For more information about request parameters, see the main project readme and
[this blog post about setting your own custom parameters](http://blog.fineuploader.com/2012/12/09/setparams-is-now-much-more-useful-in-3-1/)
along with [this post about how parameters are specified in the request](http://blog.fineuploader.com/2012/12/05/include-params-in-the-request-body-or-the-query-string/).""", "info", "Note:") }}

## Response
Your server should return a [valid JSON](http://jsonlint.com/) response.  The content-type must be "text/plain".

#### Values ####
* `{"success":true}` when upload was successful.
* `{"success": false}` if not successful, no specific reason.
* `{"error": "error message to display"}` if not successful, with a specific reason.
* `{"success": false, "error": "error message to display", "preventRetry": true}` to prevent Fine Uploader from making
any further attempts to retry uploading the file
* `{"success": false, "error": "error message to display", "reset": true}` to fail this attempt and restart with the first chunk on the next attempt.  Only applies if chunking is enabled.
Note that, if resume is also enabled, and this is the first chunk of a resume attempt, this will result in the upload starting with the first chunk immediately.
* `{"success":true, "newUuid": "abc-def-ghi"}` When you would like to override the UUID for this file provided by Fine Uploader.

Note: You can have additional custom properties in the response, but ensure that you include the "success": true property for a successful response, or it will trigger the onError callback.

## File Chunking/Partitioning
If you have file chunking turned on, each file will be split up into chunks that are sent, in order, in separate requests.

On the server-side, you must acknowledge each chunked request just as you would a non-chunked request.  If your response does
not indicate success, Fine Uploader will declare the entire file a failure.  If you have auto and/or manual retry enabled,
Fine Uploader will retry beginning with the last failed partition.

You must temporarily store each partition server-side and then concatenate all parts (to arrive at the complete file) after
the last part is sent.  See the `paramNames` chunking sub-option to see what specific parameters are sent by Fine Uploader
along with each chunked request.  These parameters will be necessary to ensure you properly parse each chunked request.  You may
order Fine Uploader to restart with the first chunk on a failed attempt by returning a `reset` property in your server response
(with a value of `true`).  This is only applicable if `autoRetry` or `manualRetry` is enabled.

You should make use of the UUID parameter, passed with each request, that uniquely identifies each file.  This may make it easier for you
to avoid collisions during accumulation of chunks between files with the same name.

Some server-side examples have been updated to handle file chunking.

For more complete details regarding the file chunking feature, along with code examples, please see [this blog post](http://blog.fineuploader.com/2012/12/28/file-chunkingpartitioning-is-now-available-in-3-2/).
on the topic.

## File Resume
There isn't much you need to do, server-side, to support file resume, other than what has been discussed in the file chunking
section above.  You can determine if a resume has been ordered by looking for a "qqresume" param with a value of true.  This
parameter will be sent with the first request of the resume.

It is important that you keep chunks around on the server until either the entire file has been uploaded
and all chunks have been merged, or until the number of days specified in the `recordsExpireIn` property of the resume option have
passed.  If, for some reason, you receive a request that indicates a resume has been ordered, and one or more of the previously uploaded
chunks is missing or invalid, you can return a valid JSON response containing a "reset" property with a value of "true".  This will
let Fine Uploader know that it should start the file upload from the first chunk instead of the last failed chunk.

For more details, please read the [blog post on the file resume feature](http://blog.fineuploader.com/2013/01/01/resume-uploads-from-previous-sessions-in-3-2/).

## Deleting Files
If you have enabled the `deleteFile` feature, you will need to handle `DELETE` or `POST` requests server-side.  The method
is configurable via the `method` property of the [`deleteFile` option](../api/options.html).

For DELETE  requests, the UUID of the file to delete will be specified as the last element of the URI path.  Any custom parameters
specified will be added to the query string.  For POST requests, the UUID is sent as a "qquuid" parameter, and a "_method"
parameter is sent with a value of "DELETE".  All POST request parameters are sent in the request payload.

Success of the request will depend solely on the response code.  Acceptable response codes that indicate success are 200,
202, and 204 for DELETE requests and 200 or 204 for POST requests.

If you would like to enable the delete file feature for cross-origin environments in IE9 or older, you will need to set
the `allowXdr` property of the `cors` client-side option and adjust your server-side code appropriately.  Keep in mind
that the Content-Type will be absent from the request header, and credentials (cookies) and [non-simple headers](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#simple-header)
cannot be sent.

Please see [the latest blog post on the delete file feature](http://blog.fineuploader.com/2013/06/05/delete-files-via-post-and-delete-requests/)
for more information.  If you want to support this feature in IE9 and IE8 for cross-origin environments, please
read about the [changes that occurred in 3.7 that optionally allow this](http://blog.fineuploader.com/2013/06/09/3-7-cross-origin-delete-file-support-for-ie9-and-ie8/).

## CORS Support
As of version 3.3, CORS is supported.  For more details on how this works, limitations, and how to properly configure your server,
please see the [blog post on CORS support](http://blog.fineuploader.com/2013/01/31/cors-support-in-3-3/).  Also, please see the
cors option documentation in the main readme.


## Providing your own UUID for files
If you would like to track files with your own generated UUID, you can return the new UUID for the file at any time in
your server's response.  If chunking is enabled, it generally would be most prudent to return this new UUID in the response
to the first or last chunk.  Once you return the new UUID in your response, Fine Uploader will update its client-side
records and begin to use that UUID from that point forward.  New UUIDs must be returned as the value of a `newUuid` property.
See the [values](#values) section above for an example.

## Handling an Overridden Filename
Simple look for a "qqfilename" parameter.  If this exists in the request, be sure to use this when naming your file server-side.
See the [blog post](http://blog.fineuploader.com/2013/06/23/3-7-edit-override-file-names/) for more details.

## Thumbnails
If you would like to override the client-side generated preview (where supported) or provide a thumbnail for a
non-previewable file that you have generated server-side, you can do so by providing an absolute or relative path (URL)
to this thumbnail in your response to the upload request via a `thumbnailUrl` property in your JSON response.  The
URL may be cross-origin as well.  See the [previews/thumbnails feature page](../features/thumbnails.html) for more
information on this feature.

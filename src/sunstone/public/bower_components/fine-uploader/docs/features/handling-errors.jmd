# Handling Errors {: .page-header }

Fine Uploader has a wealth of ways to respond to error messages.

By default, Fine Uploader asssumes an error when the server response does not
have a key of `success` set to `true`.

If any error is thrown, then the `onError` callback will be called.

## Debugging Errors

Sometimes errors are not intended, or unexpected. Fine Uploader provides the
`debug` option which will make the plugin spit out logging messages to the
client's JavaScript log.

To enable debug mode, set the `debug` option of Fine Uploader to `true`
and open the developer console in your browser. Interact with Fine Uploader
and notice that it is logging specifically what is happening. These messages
can be crucial in deciphering why something is not working as expected.

## Handling Errors

Handling error messages and errors can take place inside of the `onError`
callback. `onError` is triggered whenever Fine Uploader encounters an error.
The text to be displayed in the case of an error is passed in as the `errorReason`
parameter.

The following code snippet shows how one might display a custom alert on the
event of an error.

```javascript
$("#fine-uploader").fineUploader({
   // ...
}).on('error', function (event, id, name, errorReason, xhrOrXdr) {
    alert(qq.format("Error on file number {} - {}.  Reason: {}", id, name, errorReason));
});
```

{{ alert("jQuery 1.7+ is required to use the `on` function.") }}

## The `error` Response Property

By default, if Fine Uploader does **not** receive a successful server response
then it will look for the `error` property of the response body and will pass
that value to the `onError` callback.

If the server indicates failure in the response, but does not include an
`error` property and the response status code is `200`, then the
`defaultResponseError` property will be used as the error message.

```javascript
$("#fine-uploader").fineUploader({
    text: {
        defaultResponseError: 'An unknown upload error occurred.'
    }
});
```

## Changing Error Messages

The `messages` property in the main Fine Upload options object provides a
handful of properties one can override to display custom error messages.

```javascript
$("#fine-uploader").fineUploader({
    messages: {
        typeError: '{file} has an invalid extension. Valid extension(s): {extensions}.'
        // other messages can go here as well ...
    }
});
```

### Error Messages

Error messages include primitive `String` interpolation that allows integrators
to inject variable data into error messages. For example, the `typeError`
message could be modified:

```javascript
messages: {
    typeError: 'Invalid extension detected in file, {file}.'
}
```

and the filename of the file which the error was thrown on will be injected
instead of the `"{file}"` `String`.

## Modifying the Text for Failed Uploads

The `failedUploadTextDisplay` option defines properties used for displaying
text when an upload fails.

```javascript
$("#fine-uploader").fineUploader({
    // These are all the DEFAULT values...
    failedUploadTextDisplay: {
        mode: 'default',
        maxChars: 50,
        responseProperty: 'error',
        enableTooltip: true
    }
});
```

The `mode` property has three settings, each of which determine how failed
upload errors are displayed.

* `'default'` will display the `failUploadText` defined in the `text` option
properties next to each item.
* `'none'` will **not** display any text next to a failed item.
* `'custom'` will display an error reponse text from the server next to each
failed item).
    * `'custom'` mode will use the provided `responseProperty` (which defaults
    to `'error'`) as its text

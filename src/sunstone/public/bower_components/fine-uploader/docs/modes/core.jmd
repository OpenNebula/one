# Fine Uploader Core Mode {: .page-header }

Fine Uploader Core mode offers all the features of Fine Uploader UI mode, 
but rather than make assumptions about the UI, allows the developer to 
explicitly define which elements in the DOM Fine Uploader should act upon. 
This opens the door for finely tuned integration between Fine Uploader and 
your existing application. Choose this mode if you need very tight control 
over your uploaderâ€™s UI.

Fine Uploader Core mode is defined in the qq.FineUploaderBasic module in the code. 
This is the base module for Fine Uploader, and provides all functions that do not 
involve UI components.

Fine Uploader Core mode has a couple more options that need to be set than regular 
Fine Uploader UI mode.

For more information, see:

* [Core Mode Options](../api/options.html)
* [API Methods](../api/methods.html)
* [Events](../api/events.html)

module Straight
    # Using this strategy the service is deployed based on a directed
    # acyclic graph where each node defines its parents.
    #
    #Â For example:
    #
    #   mysql    nfs
    #      |     |  \
    #      |     |   kvm
    #       \    |   /
    #        front-end
    #
    # The above graph represents the following service:
    #
    #    "name": "my_first_service",
    #    "roles": [
    #      {
    #        "name": "front-end",
    #        "parents": [
    #          "mysql",
    #          "kvm",
    #          "nfs"
    #        ],
    #        ...
    #      },
    #      {
    #        "name": "nfs",
    #        ...
    #      },
    #      {
    #        "name": "mysql",
    #        ...
    #      },
    #      {
    #        "name": "kvm",
    #        "parents": "nfs",
    #        ...
    #      }
    #    ],
    #    "deployment": "straight"
    #  }
    #
    # The roles will be deployed in the following order:
    #   1. myslq & nfs
    #   2. kvm
    #   3. front-end
    #
    # And the service will be shutdown in the reverse order
    #   1. front-end
    #   2. kvm & myslq
    #   3. nfs

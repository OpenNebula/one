# premigrate: It is executed before a livemigration operation is issued to the hypervisor. Note that
# only the premigrate script from the system datastore will be used. Any customization must be done
# for the premigrate script of the system datastore, although you will probably add operations for
# other backends than that used by the system datastore.
# Base64 encoded VM XML is sent via stdin.
# ARGUMENTS: source_host dst_host remote_system_dir vmid dsid
#   - src_host is the host the VM is in.
#   - dst_host is the target host to migrate the VM to
#   - remote_system_ds_dir is the path for the VM directory in the system datastore in the host
#   - vmid is the id of the VM
#   - dsid is the target datastore

# List the order the servers are queried
#
# :order is defined as a list of server names and/or nested lists
# of server names (representing the availability group). The servers
# in the main list are consulted in the order they are written until
# the authentication succeeds. In the nested server lists (avail.
# groups), user is authenticated only against the first online server.
# If user is passed/refused by the server in the availability group,
# no other server is consulted from the same group, but
# the authentication process continues with the next server/group in
# the main list.
#
# Examples:
#
# 1) simple list
# :order:
#     - server1
#     - server2
#     - server3
#
# 2) list with availability group
# :order:
#     - server1
#     - ['server2', 'server3', 'server4']    # availability group
#     - server5
#
:order:
    - server 1
    #- server 2

# Default Labels Configuration
#
# This configuration defines default labels available for users and groups.
# These labels appear as empty default options in the Sunstone UI but are not saved 
# in any template until interacted with.
#
# Structure and Usage:
#
# - For 'user' labels:
#     Labels are organized as nested categories and subcategories under each user template.
#
#     Example:
#
#       user:
#         Test1:
#           A:
#             B:
#               C:
#
# - For 'group' labels:
#     The first level key is the group name.
#     Under each group, labels are organized similarly to users, with nested categories and subcategories.
#
#     Example:
#       group:
#         oneadmin:
#           Test2:
#             D:
#               E:
#                 F:
#
#         group-1:
#           GroupLabel1:
#             NestedLabel: { "vm-template": ["1","2","3"] }
#
# Note:
# - Labels under each user or group can include information about the resources they are applied to. 
#   Such as the example with "vm-template" containing an array of vm-template IDs.
# - The default labels tree structure is merged together with the user/group defined tree, 
#   with respect to the user/group tree.

            # There are 2 (mutually exclusive) options of how the servers are chosen

            # ----------
            #
            # List the order the servers are queried
            #
            # :order is defined as a list of server names and/or nested lists
            # of server names (representing the availability group). The servers
            # in the main list are consulted in the order they are written until
            # the authentication succeeds. In the nested server lists (avail.
            # groups), user is authenticated only against the first online server.
            # If user is passed/refused by the server in the availability group,
            # no other server is consulted from the same group, but
            # the authentication process continues with the next server/group in
            # the main list.
            #
            # Examples:
            #
            # 1) simple list
            # :order:
            #     - server1
            #     - server2
            #     - server3
            #
            # 2) list with availability group
            # :order:
            #     - server1
            #     - ['server2', 'server3', 'server4']    # availability group
            #     - server5
            #
            :order:
                - server 1
                #- server 2
            #
            # 2. :match_user_regex:
            # ---------------------
            #
            # Allows mapping user by matching a regex to a particual LDAP server
            # or server list
            #
            # Example:
            #
            # :match_user_regex:
            #   "^(.*)@orgA$": server1
            #   "^(.*)@orgB$": server2
            #   "^(.*)@orgC$": ['server3', 'server4']
            #
            #  In this example user `joe@orgA` will be searched in server1 and user
            #  `paul@orgC` will be searched in server3 (and server4 if not found)
            #
            #  If the regex contains capture group like here, only this part of the
            #  username is searched  in the LDAP actually. So the user entry only
            #  have attribute like `cn: paul`. The suffix is only used to identify
            #  the server.

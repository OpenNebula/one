# This option specifies the main filters for PCI card monitoring. The format
# is the same as used by lspci to filter on PCI card by vendor:device(:class)
# identification. Several filters can be added as a list, or separated
# by commas. The NULL filter will retrieve all PCI cards.
#
# From lspci help:
#     -d [<vendor>]:[<device>][:<class>]
#            Show only devices with specified vendor, device and  class  ID.
#            The  ID's  are given in hexadecimal and may be omitted or given
#            as "*", both meaning "any value"#
#
# For example:
#   :filter:
#     - '10de:*'      # all NVIDIA VGA cards
#     - '10de:11bf'   # only GK104GL [GRID K2]
#     - '*:10d3'      # only 82574L Gigabit Network cards
#     - '8086::0c03'  # only Intel USB controllers
#
# or
#
#   :filter: '*:*'    # all devices
#
# or
#
#   :filter: '0:0'    # no devices
#
:filter: '0:0'

# The PCI cards list restricted by the :filter option above can be even more
# filtered by the list of exact PCI addresses (bus:device.func).
#
# For example:
#   :short_address:
#     - '07:00.0'
#     - '06:00.0'
#
:short_address: []

# The PCI cards list restricted by the :filter option above can be even more
# filtered by matching the device name against the list of regular expression
# case-insensitive patterns.
#
# For example:
#   :device_name:
#     - 'Virtual Function'
#     - 'Gigabit Network'
#     - 'USB.*Host Controller'
#     - '^MegaRAID'
#
:device_name: []

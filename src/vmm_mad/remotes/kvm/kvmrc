# IDE and SCSI disks always have the ability to issue "discard"
# (aka TRIM or UNMAP) commands. However, by default "discard" commands are
# silently ignored as they can cause performance degradation and fragmentation.
# To enable them, the "-drive" option now supports a "discard" suboption; the
# default value is "ignore" (or its synonym "off"), and the other valid value
# is "unmap" (or "on").
#DEFAULT_ATTACH_DISCARD=unmap

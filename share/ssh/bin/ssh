# This is a SSH command (ssh) wrapper to workaround issues with master sockets
# for the persistent connections - it will add '-o ControlMaster=auto' to the
# ssh command in some specific cases (where it does not hang the SSH session).
#
# NOTE: It can be disabled by setting the env. var 'SSH_USE_MASTER_SOCK' to
# 'no' - e.g.: by overriding the systemd unit 'opennebula.service'.

# This is a SSH command (ssh) wrapper to workaround issues with master sockets
# for the persistent connections - it will add '-o ControlMaster=auto' to the
# ssh command in some specific cases (where it does not hang the SSH session).
#
# NOTE: It can be overriden by setting the env. var 'SSH_OPT_CONTROL_MASTER'
# either directly when run manually in the shell or in the systemd unit
# 'opennebula.service' (e.g.: Environment="SSH_OPT_CONTROL_MASTER=no").
# In either case it must be a valid value for SSH's 'ControlMaster' option...

#
# global variables
#

# fix the PATH again...

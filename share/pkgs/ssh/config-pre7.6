# We check if remote host key is not already in the known hosts and
# if NOT, we expect this is the very first access and accept the key.
# All further accesses already use strict host key checking.

  # for OpenSSH race condition during close of the master socket.

  # 'ControlPersist' cannot be set less than 120 (two minutes) to offset the
  # minimum one minute time before each cronjob check! It will also not change
  # behavior even if it set much higher or to infinity (0).

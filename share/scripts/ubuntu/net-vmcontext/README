Using the vmcontext script with upstart init daemon
---------------------------------------------------

If you are using a recent Ubuntu release it will be using upstart [1] instead of
the classical system-V init scripts. In that case You have to change two files:

* /etc/init/networking.conf:

    diff -uNr /etc/init.orig/networking.conf /etc/init/networking.conf
    --- /etc/init.orig/networking.conf	2010-12-25 13:43:14.910534106 +0100
    +++ /etc/init/networking.conf	2010-12-25 13:43:58.930531358 +0100

    +pre-start script
    +    /etc/init.d/vmcontext
    +    mkdir -p /var/run/network
    +end script

* /etc/init/network-interface.conf:

    diff -uNr /etc/init.orig/network-interface.conf /etc/init/network-interface.conf

        # bring this up even if /etc/network/interfaces is broken
        ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1 up || true

The previous diffs show an example on how they should be applied, but do not try
to apply them exactly as is, since those files may change between Ubuntu
releases.

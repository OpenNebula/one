# WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
#
# This script needs to be modified to enable fencing of the host. By default it
# will fail, as the first line is 'exit 1'. You will need to remove it.
#
# In order to perform the fencing, you will probably need to install a fencing
# utility. They are typically found in: fence-agents-all (CentOS) and fence-
# agents (Ubuntu). They come with many utilities: fence_ilo, fence_ipmilan,
# fence_apc, etc...
#
# To call the fencing utility, you will need to pass some parameters, which are
# typically the iLO IP of the host, etc. We recommend you enter this information
# in the host's template, and pick it up using the xpath example below. AS AN
# EXAMPLE (only an example) the script below expects that you have defined a
# parameter called FENCE_IP in the Host's template, and it will rely on that to
# call the fencing mechanism. You should customize this to your needs. It is
# perfectly OK to discard the code below and use a different mechanism, like
# storing the information required to perform the fencing in a separate CMDB,
# etc. However, you will probably need to get the host's NAME, which should be
# done as shown below.
